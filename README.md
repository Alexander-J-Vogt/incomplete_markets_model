# Policy Analysis of the First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit
The term paper consist of a referee report on “Consumption Dynamics During Recessions “ by Berger & Vavra (2015) and a research proposal. Thereby, the research proposal develops a heterogenous-agent incomplete market model with housing choices, a mortgage market and fixed costs for the housing stock adjustments based on Berger & Vavra (2015) in order to analyze the mechanism of the First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit. Thereby, the housing choices are inspired by De Francisco (2021), and the mortgage market of the same paper is completely incorporated into the research proposal’s model and extended by mortgage payments. In addition, a central decision must be made by the households whether to save into risk-free liquid assets or to take out a mortgage in order to buy a house induced by the difference between the borrowing rate and the risk-free interest rate. This modeled mechanism would enable to generate a framework that allows to study the First-Time Homebuyer Tax Credit and help to understand the outcome of this fiscal stimulus. Especially the effectiveness of the stimulus is an interesting aspect to evaluate in this model since Berger & Vavra (2015) suggest lower responsiveness of durable expenditures to shocks.
